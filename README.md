#The Genesis Synth

##Overview

This program is for modifying a Yamaha YM2612 chip into a MIDI synthesizer. The Sega Genesis is known among people who grew up in the 90â€™s for not only its original games but the very distinct sounds and music that came from them. We aim to harness those tones and create a MIDI device that can be used to make our own Sega sound compositions. 

This project is loosely based on the work of Fabien Batteix (also known as SkyWodd) and fastman0204 (whose work can be found on youtube). We used their code and build to begin the process of understanding the fairly undocumented YM2612 chip.

The main components of this project are:

AT Mega 2560
Yamaha YM2612 sound chip
MIDI
LM386 Audio Amplifier
DJ Box (sourced from Dollarama)

##Remarks
The YM2612 sound chip is difficult because of the lack of documentation and is yet to be fully understood. To generate a single note we used a prewritten VGM file and were able to modify it for our own purposes and create a second note.
